# CAPSTONE_PROJECT

Disease prediction using machine learning models has become an essential area of research in
healthcare, and Django and MongoDB provide a robust and scalable platform to build and
deploy disease prediction applications. The project aims to develop a disease prediction
application that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a
particular disease based on their medical history. 

The application is user-friendly, efficient, and
complies with healthcare industry data privacy and security standards. Additionally, the
application provides a dashboard for healthcare providers to monitor the predictions, is easy to
deploy on a web server, and the model should be easily updatable with new data.
This application aims to provide a quick and efficient way for individuals to assess
potential health issues based on their symptoms. 

The application collects data related to
diseases and symptoms from various sources, pre-processes the data, and trains a machine-learning model to predict potential diseases based on input symptoms.
Django is an excellent choice for developing web applications due to its robustness, scalability,
and flexibility. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their symptoms and
receive disease predictions. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that can handle unstructured data,
making it an ideal choice for storing data related to diseases and symptoms.
The disease prediction application using Django and MongoDB has the potential to
revolutionize the healthcare industry. It provides a quick and efficient way for individuals to
assess their health, which could lead to early detection and treatment of diseases. This
application could also reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus
on more critical tasks.
